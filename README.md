## Features

* displayed info (metric or imperial units):
  * temperature range ([felt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill) and measured)
  * windspeed and direction
  * viewing distance
  * precipitation amount and probability
* ssl, so the NSA has a harder time learning where you live or plan to go
* multi language support
* config file for default location which can be overridden by commandline
* Automatic config management with [ingo](https://github.com/schachmat/ingo)

## Dependencies

* A [working](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) [Go](https://golang.org/)
  [1.20](https://golang.org/doc/go1.20) environment 
* utf-8 terminal with 256 colors
* A monospaced font containing all the required runes (I use `dejavu sans
  mono`)
* An API key for the backend (see Setup below)

## Installation

Check your distribution for packaging:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/wego.svg)](https://repology.org/project/wego/versions)

To directly install or update the wego binary from Github into your `$GOPATH` as usual, run:
```shell
go install github.com/schachmat/wego@latest
```

## Setup

0. Run `wego` once. You will get an error message, but the `.wegorc` config file
   will be generated in your `$HOME` directory (it will be hidden in some file
   managers due to the filename starting with a dot).
0. __With an [Openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/) account__
    * You can create an account and get a free API key by [signing up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:
    ```
      backend=openweathermap
      location=New York
      owm-api-key=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
0. __With a [Worldweatheronline](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/) account__
    * Worldweatheronline no longer gives out free API keys. [#83](https://github.com/schachmat/wego/issues/83)
    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:
    ```
      backend=worldweatheronline
      location=New York
      wwo-api-key=YOUR_WORLDWEATHERONLINE_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
0. __With a [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) account__
    * You can create an account and get a free API key by [signing up](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx)
    * Update the following `.wegorc` config variables to fit your needs:
    ```
      backend=weatherapi
      location=New York
      weather-api-key=YOUR_WEATHERAPI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
0. You may want to adjust other preferences like `days`, `units` and `â€¦-lang` as
   well. Save the file.
0. Run `wego` once again and you should get the weather forecast for the current
   and next few days for your chosen location.
0. If you're visiting someone in e.g. London over the weekend, just run `wego 4
   London` or `wego London 4` (the ordering of arguments makes no difference) to
   get the forecast for the current and the next 3 days.

You can set the `$WEGORC` environment variable to override the default config
file location.

## Todo
