**wego** is a weather client for the terminal.

##Features

![Screenshots](http://schachmat.github.io/wego/wego.gif)

* show forecast for 1 to 5 days
* nice ASCII art icons
* displayed info (metric or imperial units):
  * temperature
  * windspeed and direction
  * viewing distance
  * precipitation amount and probability
  * multiple cities
* ssl, so the NSA has a harder time learning where you live or plan to go
* multi language support
* config file for default location which can be overridden by commandline
* Automatic config management with [ingo](https://github.com/schachmat/ingo)

##Dependencies

* A [working](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) [Go](https://golang.org/)
  [1.5](https://golang.org/doc/go1.5) environment (You can use
  [goenv](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/goenv) if your distribution does not
  support Go 1.5 yet)
* utf-8 terminal with 256 colors
* A sane monospaced font containing all the required runes (I use `dejavu sans
  mono`)
* A worldweatheronline.com API key (see Setup below)

##Installation

To Install the wego binary into your `$GOPATH` as usual, run:
```shell
go get -u github.com/schachmat/wego
```

##Setup

0. Run `wego` once. You will get an error message, but the config file will be
   generated for you as well.
0. If you don't have the necessary API key yet, you can [register
   here](https://developer.worldweatheronline.com/auth/register) with your
   github.com or facebook account. Your github.com account needs a public email
   address, but you can choose a bogus one.
0. Copy your API key into the `.wegorc` file in your `$HOME` folder (it will be
   hidden in some file managers), change the city to your preference, and choose
   if you want to use metric or imperial units. Save the file.
0. Run `wego` once again and you should get the weather forecast for the current
   and next 2 days.
0. If you're visiting someone in e.g. London over the weekend, just run `wego 4
   London` or `wego London 4` (the ordering of arguments makes no difference) to
   get the forecast for the current and the next 3 days.

You can set the `$WEGORC` environment variable to override the default config
file location.
