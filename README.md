* nice ASCII art icons
* displayed info:
  * temperature
  * windspeed and direction

##Dependencies

* Working Go environment
* utf-8 terminal with 256 colors
* A worldweatheronline.com API key (see Setup below)

##Setup

1. To Install the wego binary into your `$GOPATH` as usual, run:
   `go get github.com/schachmat/wego`
2. Run `wego` once. You will get an error message, but the config file will be
   generated for you as well.
3. If you don't have the necessary API key yet, you can [register
   here](https://developer.worldweatheronline.com/auth/register) with your
   github.com account. Your github.com account needs a public email address, but
   you can choose a bogus one.
4. Copy your API key into the `.wegorc` file in your `$HOME` folder, change
   the city to your preference, and choose either `metric` or `imperial` units. Save the file.
5. Run `wego` once again and you should get the weather forecast for the current
   and next 2 days.
6. If you're visiting someone in e.g. London over the weekend, just run
   `wego 4 London` or `wego London 4` (the ordering of arguments makes no
   difference) to get the forecast for the current and the next 3 days.
